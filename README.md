## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to adapt to different screen sizes using CSS Flexbox. I achieved this by separating the image from the rest of the card content inside a flexbox and changing the `flex-direction` property depending on the screen size.

### Useful resources

- ["Flexbox item widths are affected by padding" on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32099624/flexbox-item-widths-are-affected-by-padding) and ["CSS flex Property" by w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex.php) - This helped me when evenly distributing the items inside the flexbox for desktop viewing because of the added padding by the content.
- ["Changing Image depending on Mobile or Desktop HTML & CSS" on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28966158/changing-image-depending-on-mobile-or-desktop-html-css) - This helped me when changing the perfume image depending on screen size.
